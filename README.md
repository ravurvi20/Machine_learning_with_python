Data Preprocessing: I have honed my data preprocessing skills, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering. This step is crucial for ensuring that the data is suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I've employed EDA techniques to gain a deep understanding of the datasets. Visualizations, statistical summaries, and data profiling have helped me identify patterns, outliers, and potential relationships within the data.

Feature Selection and Engineering: I've learned how to select relevant features and engineer new ones to improve model performance. Techniques such as one-hot encoding, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction have been employed as needed.
